Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood", "The area is prone to earthquakes.", "The land is prone to flooding.", "Tsunamis, or tidal waves, are caused by sudden movements of the ocean floor.", "Earthquakes and tsunamis pose a threat to the city.", "A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry."]
