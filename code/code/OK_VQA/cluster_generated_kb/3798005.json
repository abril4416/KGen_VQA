["Trains use air brakes to stop themselves on the tracks. Air brakes use compressed air to apply the brakes on the train cars, slowing them down and eventually stopping them.", "Trains use a combination of air brakes and wheel brakes to stop. Air brakes use compressed air to slow and stop the train, while wheel brakes use friction to slow and stop the train.", "Trains use a combination of air brakes and track brakes to stop. Air brakes use compressed air to slow and stop the train, while track brakes use friction to slow and stop the train.", "The train would stop itself on the tracks by using a combination of brakes and the friction created between the wheels and the tracks.", "The train would use a combination of brakes, including air brakes, dynamic brakes, and mechanical brakes, to slow itself down.", "The train would stop itself on the tracks by using an air brake system, which is a system of brakes that uses compressed air to apply the brakes on the train's wheels.", "Most modern trains use a combination of air brakes and electromagnetic rail brakes to stop. Air brakes use compressed air to slow the train, while electromagnetic brakes use electromagnets to create friction and slow the train.", "The train would stop itself on the tracks by using a combination of brakes, such as air brakes, dynamic brakes, and electric brakes.", "A train stops by applying the brakes on the wheels and the track, which causes the train to slow down and eventually come to a stop.", "The train will stop itself by using a combination of brakes and the friction of the rails. The brakes can be applied manually by the engineer, or automatically by the onboard computer system. The friction of the rails will act as a natural brake, slowing the train down gradually.", "Trains use a combination of brakes and wheel chocks to stop themselves on the tracks. The brakes are used to slow the train, and the wheel chocks are placed in front of the wheels to prevent them from rolling.", "Trains use a combination of air brakes and track brakes to stop. Air brakes use compressed air to push brake shoes against the wheels, while track brakes use friction to slow the train down.", "A train uses a combination of air brakes, track brakes, and wheel brakes to stop itself on the tracks. The air brakes use compressed air to create friction and slow the train, while the track brakes use steel shoes to press against the tracks and slow the train. The wheel brakes use friction to slow the train.", "Trains use a combination of air brakes and mechanical brakes to stop. Air brakes use compressed air to apply the brakes and mechanical brakes use friction between the wheels and the track to slow the train.", "Trains use a combination of brakes and air brakes to stop. The brakes are operated by the engineer and can be applied to the wheels of the train, which creates friction and slows the train down. Air brakes use compressed air to slow the train down, and are usually used when the train is traveling at higher speeds.", "The train will stop itself on the tracks by engaging the brakes, which will slow the train down until it comes to a complete stop.", "Trains use a combination of air brakes, which use compressed air to slow and stop the train, and hand brakes, which are manually operated brakes used to stop the train.", "A train uses its brakes to slow down and stop on the tracks.", "Modern trains use a combination of air brakes and dynamic brakes to stop. The air brakes use compressed air to apply the brakes while the dynamic brakes use the electric motors of the train to slow it down.", "Trains are usually stopped by the use of brakes. Brakes are used to slow down and eventually stop the train. The brakes are activated by the engineer, and they work by applying friction to the wheels of the train.", "Trains use air brakes to slow down and stop. Air brakes work by using compressed air to apply pressure to the brake shoes, which are then used to slow and stop the train.", "The train would use a combination of air brakes and wheel brakes to stop itself. Air brakes use compressed air to slow down the train, while wheel brakes use friction to slow down the train.", "The train will stop itself on the tracks by using its brakes. The brakes are usually operated by air pressure, and when the brakes are applied, the train's wheels will lock up and the train will slow down and eventually come to a stop.", "The train would use its brakes to slow down and eventually stop on the tracks.", "Trains are stopped by the application of brakes on their wheels, which slow the train down gradually. The brakes are operated by the engineer or driver, and are usually assisted by air brakes that are applied automatically when the engineer pulls the brake lever."]
