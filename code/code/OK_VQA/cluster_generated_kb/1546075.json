["A climate is the weather condition of a region. Climate is defined as statistical weather information that describes the variation of weather at a given place for a specified interval.", "Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.", "The trees flourish in a temperate climate.", "Trees grow in all climates.", "Trees grow in a variety of climates.", "The climate of the United States varies due to changes in latitude, and a range of geographic features, including mountains and deserts.", "The climate of a region depends on the latitude, altitude, and local conditions.", "The climate of the Arctic is characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers.", "A temperate climate is a climate usually found between the latitudes of 25 and 50 degrees north and south of the equator.", "A wooden bench is a wooden bench.", "The climate of the United States varies due to differences in latitude, and a range of geographic features, including mountains and deserts. Generally, on the mainland, the climate of the U.S. becomes warmer the further south one travels, and drier the further west, until one reaches the West Coast.", "The trees are green, so they thrive in a temperate climate.", "Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.", "Dry climate is characterized by low rainfall.", "A temperate climate is a climate typically found between the tropics and the polar regions of Earth.", "The climate of the tropics is warm and wet.", "The climate of the tropical rainforest is hot and wet. Tropical rainforests are found around the equator.", "The climate of a region depends on the latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea and ocean currents.", "The trees flourish in a warm climate.", "The climate is a climate.", "Trees are a type of plant that are made up of a trunk, branches, leaves and a root system. Trees are found in all climates.", "The climate is humid subtropical.", "The trees live in a temperate climate.", "Trees are a large group of plants.", "The trees flourish in a temperate climate.", "Trees in temperate climates have a dormant period during the winter.", "The climate is warm and dry.", "Trees flourish in a temperate climate.", "Trees flourish in a temperate climate.", "Those trees flourish in warm climate.", "A humid subtropical climate is a zone of climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and cold to mild winters.", "A climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.", "Trees that grow in the desert.", "Trees flourish in the dry season.", "Trees are a group of plants. They are tall plants with hard, thick stems (called trunks). The main stem of a tree is called a trunk. The trunk is covered by a layer of bark. The bark protects the inner layers of the tree.", "The climate of a region is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents.", "Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator.", "Trees grow in climates that are temperate and tropical.", "Trees grow in temperate climates.", "Trees are perennial plants, meaning that they live for more than two years.", "There are many different types of trees that grow in different climates.", "Trees are a kind of plant, a tall plant that has a thick, wooden stem. Trees usually have many branches that spread out from the stem and grow leaves.", "Trees are one of the most common plants in the world. They are found on every continent, in almost every habitat, and they are important to most ecosystems. They provide food, shelter, and medicine for people and animals.", "Trees that flourish in a temperate climate are those that grow in the cool, moist and windy conditions of the temperate zone.", "Tropical trees flourish in tropical climate.", "A climate is the weather condition of a region.", "Trees are a group of plants that form a deep root system and have a single main stem.", "Trees grow best in a moist climate.", "Trees grow best in a humid climate.", "A tree bench is a type of bench that wraps around a tree, allowing people to sit around it."]
