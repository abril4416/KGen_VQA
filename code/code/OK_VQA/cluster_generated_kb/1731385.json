The moon's gravitational pull causes the ocean to experience high and low tides. The sun's gravitational pull also affects the ocean's currents.", "The movements of the ocean are controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The moon's gravity causes the ocean tides to rise and fall twice a day. The sun's gravity also affects the ocean, causing the water to bulge out in the direction of the sun.", "The movements of the body of water featured in this photo are controlled by the Moon's gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans, which causes the tides to rise and fall.", "The Moon's gravitational pull creates the ocean tides, which are the regular rise and fall of the sea level. The Moon's gravitational force pulls the water towards it, creating two bulges in the ocean on either side of the Moon.", "The movement of the ocean featured in this photo is controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon.", "The ocean's movements are primarily controlled by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun.", "The moon controls the movements of the body of water featured in this photo.
