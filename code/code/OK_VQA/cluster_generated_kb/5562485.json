["The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth.", "A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.", "The water source is called a stream.", "A body of water or waterbody is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface.", "A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake.", "A stream is a body of water with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel.", "A body of water or waterbody is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface.", "A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake.", "The water source is a lake.", "A body of water is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface.", "A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake.", "A body of water is called a lake, pond, or ocean.", "Water sources include lakes, rivers, oceans, and ponds.", "A natural spring is a water source formed by nature.", "A water source is a place where water is found, such as a spring, stream, river, pond, lake, reservoir, or well.", "A water source is called a river in this environment.", "Water is a transparent fluid which forms the world's streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of organisms.", "A water source is a place where water can be obtained.", "The water source is called a body of water.", "A body of water or waterbody (often spelled water body) is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface.", "A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.
