["A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.", "The train is a double decker train.", "This is a subway train.", "A yellow train is a train that has yellow color.", "The Orient Express was a long-distance passenger train service created in 1883 by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits.", "The first passenger railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1830.", "A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers.", "An electric multiple unit or EMU is a multiple unit train consisting of self-propelled carriages, using electricity as the motive power.
