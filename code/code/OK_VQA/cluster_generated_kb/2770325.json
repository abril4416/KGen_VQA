Since snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a granular material. It has an open and therefore soft, white, and fluffy structure, unless subjected to external pressure. Snowflakes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Types that fall in the form of a ball due to melting and refreezing, rather than a flake, are known as hail, ice pellets or snow grains. The process of precipitating snow is called snowfall.

It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.", "Snow is a type of precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice.", "The ground is covered by snow.", "The ground is covered in snow.", "Snow is a type of precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice.", "snow", "Snow is covering the ground.", "Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds.", "The ground is covered in snow.", "Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds.", "It is snowing.", "Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds.", "The ground is covered by snow.", "The ground is covered by snow.", "The ground is covered by snow.", "The ground is covered in snow.", "Snow", "Snow is a type of precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes that fall from clouds.", "The ground is covered with snow.", "Snow is a type of precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes that fall from clouds.", "The ground is covered with snow.", "Snow is a form of ice.", "Snow is a type of precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes that fall from clouds.", "The ground is covered with snow.", "The ground is covered in snow.", "Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds.
