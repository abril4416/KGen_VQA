["Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons, and is similar to diesel fuel and kerosene.", "Most commercial jets use Jet A fuel, which is a kerosene-based fuel.", "Most commercial jet aircraft use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel derived from crude oil. Jet fuel is a kerosene-based fuel, and is composed of hydrocarbons with between 6 and 16 carbon atoms.", "Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel made from a mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil. Jet fuel is highly flammable and is used to power the engines of jet aircraft.", "Jets typically use kerosene-based jet fuel, which is a combination of hydrocarbons and other compounds.", "Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons and is similar to diesel fuel and kerosene.", "Jets use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed specifically for use in jet engines.", "Jets use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft turbine engines. It is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and contains additives to reduce corrosion, improve performance, and reduce smoke and exhaust emissions.", "Most modern jet aircraft are powered by jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel made from a blend of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil.", "Jets use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines.", "Jets use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines.", "Most commercial jets use jet fuel, a type of kerosene.", "Most modern jet aircraft use a type of fuel known as Jet-A or Jet-A1, which is a kerosene-based fuel.", "Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel made from a mixture of hydrocarbons, such as kerosene, and other additives. Jet fuel is highly flammable and is used to power the engines of aircraft.", "Most modern jet aircraft use a type of fuel called Jet A, which is a kerosene-based fuel. Jet A is a highly refined kerosene fuel, designed to burn more efficiently and with fewer pollutants than traditional kerosene fuels.", "Jets use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines.", "Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a highly refined petroleum-based fuel that is designed to provide maximum efficiency and power.", "Jets typically use jet fuel, which is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. Jet fuel is a mixture of hydrocarbons, containing about 10-15% aromatics and some additives for improved performance and stability.", "Modern jet engines typically use a combination of jet fuel and air to produce thrust.
