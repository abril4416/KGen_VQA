["The direction of the wind is determined by the direction from which it is blowing.", "The wind direction is determined by observing the direction the kites are flying.", "The direction of the wind is determined by the direction of air movement from high pressure to low pressure. To determine the direction of the wind, look for the direction of the clouds or smoke in the sky.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by observing the direction in which the kites are flying. If the kites are flying in a straight line, then the wind is blowing in the same direction. If the kites are flying in circles, then the wind is blowing in different directions.", "The wind direction can be determined by observing the direction in which the kites are flying.", "The wind direction is from the east, as the kites are being flown in the air.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by looking at the direction of the kite's flight. If the kite is flying away from you, the wind is blowing from behind you. If the kite is flying towards you, the wind is blowing from in front of you.", "The direction of the wind is determined by the direction of the air flow. Winds typically blow from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.", "The wind direction can be determined by observing the direction in which the kites are flying. If the kites are flying in a straight line, the wind is blowing from the direction the kites are moving.", "Kites are typically flown in the direction of the wind, so the direction of the wind can be determined by observing the direction in which the kites are flying.", "The wind direction is determined by the direction the kites are flying.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by looking at the direction of the kites. If the kites are flying away from you, then the wind is blowing from you towards the kites. If the kites are flying towards you, then the wind is blowing from the kites towards you.", "The wind direction for kite flying is usually from the side or slightly behind the kite flyer.", "The wind direction is determined by the direction the kites are flying in.", "The direction of the wind is determined by the direction from which the air is moving. If the air is moving from the north, then the wind is blowing from the north.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by observing the movement of the kites. If the kites are moving in a particular direction, then the wind is coming from the opposite direction.", "The wind direction is determined by the direction that the kite is flying.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by observing the direction of the kites as they fly.", "The direction of the wind can be determined by the direction the kites are flying.", "The direction of the wind is determined by the direction of the air flow. Wind direction is usually reported in terms of the direction from which it originates. For example, if the wind is blowing from the north, it is said to be a northerly wind.", "Kites are typically flown in areas with a steady wind. The direction of the wind can be determined by looking at the direction the kites are flying in. If the kites are flying in a straight line, the wind is likely coming from the same direction.", "The wind direction is determined by the direction the kite is flying.", "The wind direction is from the east.", "Kites require wind to fly, so the direction of the wind can be determined by watching the direction of the kites.", "The wind direction is from the west."]
