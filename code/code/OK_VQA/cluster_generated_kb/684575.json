["An airport runway is the area of an airport used for aircraft to take off and land.", "The airplane is likely located at an airport, as airplanes are typically parked on the runway at airports.", "Aircrafts are most commonly seen at airports, which are generally located near large cities.", "The airplane is most likely seen at an airport or airfield, which is an aerodrome with extended facilities for commercial air transport.", "The location is likely an airport, as airplanes are typically seen parked on runways at airports.", "The aeroplane is likely located at an airport or airfield.", "The location of the aeroplane is likely an airport or airfield. Airports and airfields are places where aircrafts take off and land.", "The airplane is likely at an airport.", "The location of the aeroplane can be determined by looking at the type of aircraft, the runway markings, and the surroundings. If the aircraft is a commercial airliner, it could be at any major airport. If the aircraft is a military plane, it could be at a military base.", "The aeroplane is seen at an airport.", "The airplane is likely located at an airport or airfield, as this is where airplanes typically take off and land.", "The location of the airplane is likely an airport or airfield, as these are the locations where airplanes are typically parked on a runway.", "The location where the aeroplane is seen is likely an airport, as airplanes are typically seen parked on runways at airports.", "The location of an airplane can be determined by its position relative to the ground, its altitude, and its heading.", "The location could be an airport, as airplanes are typically seen parked on the runway at airports.", "The aeroplane is likely located at an airport or airbase.", "The location of the aeroplane is likely an airport or airfield, as these are the only places where aircrafts are typically parked on a runway.", "An airport is a location where aircraft take off and land, and where passengers and cargo are loaded and unloaded. It is usually a large area of land with a long runway, hangars, taxiways, and other facilities for aircraft.", "The location where the airplane is seen is likely an airport since airplanes are typically parked on runways at airports.", "An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals.", "An airport is an area where aircraft take off and land, and where passengers and cargo are handled.", "The aircraft appears to be located at an airport, possibly in the United States, due to the presence of the cardinal bird, which is the state bird of seven US states.", "The airplane is likely parked at an airport, as they are the only places where large aircraft can take off and land.", "The airplane is likely seen at an airport, as the tail of the airplane is parked on the runway and there is a hangar nearby.", "The cardinal is a symbol of the United States Air Force, and is typically seen on aircraft parked at Air Force bases around the world."]
