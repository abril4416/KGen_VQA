["The jet is moving faster than the airplane since it is leaving a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor that forms behind an aircraft flying at high altitudes.", "The airplane in the foreground is moving faster than the one in the background.", "The airplane that is producing the contrail is moving faster than the other airplane.", "The jet is moving faster than the airplane.", "The airplane that is leaving the contrail is moving faster than the one that is not leaving a contrail.", "The airplane in the front is moving faster because it is creating the contrail. The contrail is caused by the faster moving airplane pushing air out of its way, creating a visible trail of water vapor.", "The airplane is moving faster than the jet trail because the jet trail is the exhaust from the airplane and is being left behind.", "The jet is moving faster than the airplane as it is leaving a trail of smoke behind it.", "The airplane that is trailing the smoke is moving faster, as the smoke is being left behind it.", "The airplane that is leaving the jet trail is moving faster than the one behind it.", "The plane that is moving faster is the one with the contrail behind it, as the contrail is an indication of its speed.", "The jet is moving faster than the plane. Jet engines are more powerful than propeller engines, allowing them to reach higher speeds.", "The jet is moving faster than the airplane because it is leaving a visible contrail or condensation trail.", "The airplane that is leaving the contrail is moving faster than the other airplane.", "The jet is moving faster than the plane, as it is leaving behind a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor created by the jet's exhaust.", "The airplane in the foreground is moving faster than the airplane in the background, as it is closer to the viewer and the jet trail is behind it.", "The airplane that is leaving the jet trail is moving faster than the one that is not leaving a jet trail.", "The jet is moving faster than the airplane because it is leaving a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor created by the jet exhaust.", "The jet is moving faster since it is leaving a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor created by an airplane when it is flying at high altitudes.", "The jet is moving faster because it is leaving a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor created by an aircraft engine.", "The jet is moving faster since it is leaving a contrail behind it.", "The jet is moving faster because it is creating a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensed water vapor created by an aircraft's exhaust.", "The airplane is moving faster because it is leaving a contrail, which is a visible trail of condensation created by the jet engine exhaust.", "The plane that is trailing the smoke is moving faster than the one in front of it.", "The speed of an airplane is determined by the thrust of its engines and the drag of the air it is flying through."]
