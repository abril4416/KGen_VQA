["Microwave ovens heat food without getting hot themselves.", "Microwave ovens are known to cause severe burns.", "Microwave ovens heat food by passing microwaves through it. The microwaves are absorbed by water, fats, and sugars, causing them to vibrate and build up thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating.", "The microwave oven is a kitchen appliance that heats food by bombarding it with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25\u201338 mm (1\u20131.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item.", "Microwave ovens use microwave radiation to heat water and other polar molecules in food to heat food.", "Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter to one millimeter.", "Microwave ovens heat food by passing microwave radiation through it.", "Microwaves can cook food extremely quickly because they can penetrate the food and heat it from within.
