["The water recedes due to the pull of the moon's gravitational force, which causes the ocean's tides to rise and fall.", "The water recedes due to the action of waves, tides, and wind.", "The ocean's water levels are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, as well as the rotation of the Earth. This causes the ocean to rise and fall in a regular cycle known as the tides.", "The ocean's waves and tides cause the water to recede and rise. The waves and tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.", "The ocean recedes due to the effects of tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.", "The ocean recedes due to the gravitational pull of the moon, which causes the tide to come in and out.", "The ocean water recedes due to the action of the tides. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, which cause the water to rise and fall twice a day.", "The ocean's tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.", "The receding of the water is caused by the ebb and flow of the tides.", "The ocean's tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the earth's oceans. The gravitational pull causes the ocean's water to bulge outward on the side closest to the moon, and inward on the side farthest from the moon.", "The receding of the water is caused by the tides, which are the regular rise and fall of the sea level due to the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.", "The receding of the water is caused by the tide, which is the regular rise and fall of the sea level due to the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.", "The water recedes due to the effects of the tide, which is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.", "The water recedes due to the action of the waves and tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.", "The water recedes due to the effects of the tide. The tide is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the earth's oceans.", "The ocean recedes due to the effects of tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the Earth's oceans.", "The water recedes due to the gravitational pull of the moon on the Earth's oceans, which causes the ocean's water level to rise and fall twice a day. This phenomenon is called the tidal cycle.", "The water is caused to recede by the action of the waves and tides, which cause the water level to rise and fall.", "The ocean's water level is affected by the tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.", "Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the earth's oceans.", "The receding of water is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The gravitational pull of the moon causes the ocean to bulge in the direction of the moon, creating high tides. The gravitational pull of the sun causes the ocean to bulge away from the sun, creating low tides.", "The water recedes due to the tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.", "The water recedes due to the effects of the tide, which is a regular rise and fall in the level of the ocean caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.", "The water in the ocean recedes due to the effects of the tides. The tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the earth's oceans.", "The water recedes due to the action of waves and tides. Waves are caused by wind, and tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun."]
