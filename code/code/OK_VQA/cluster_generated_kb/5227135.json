["Cumulus clouds are puffy, often described as \"cotton-like\" or \"fluffy\" in appearance. They are generally white, but may appear in a variety of colors depending upon the time of day and how the sunlight is interacting with them.", "Clouds are a visible mass of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.", "These are cumulus clouds. Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as \"puffy\", \"cotton-like\" or \"fluffy\" in appearance. They are often white, but may be of almost any color.", "Clouds are formed by the condensation of water vapor in the air.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are very tall, dense, and involved in thunderstorm activity.", "Cumulus clouds are often described as puffy, cotton-like or fluffy in appearance. Cumulus clouds, being low-level clouds, are generally less than 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form.", "These clouds are cumulonimbus clouds.", "Cumulonimbus are a dense, towering vertical cloud, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents. If observed during a storm, these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads. Cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along cold front squall lines. These clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather, such as tornadoes. Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell. Cumulonimbus is abbreviated Cb and are designated in the D2 family.", "Clouds are a visible mass of tiny water droplets or frozen ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of the Earth or another planetary body.", "Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that are often seen high in the sky. They are made of ice crystals and are very thin. They often look like white feathers, or the mane of a horse. Cirrus clouds are the highest of all clouds and are composed entirely of ice crystals.", "Cumulus clouds are puffy, white, and look like floating cotton. They are often called fair weather clouds because they usually indicate good weather.", "High-level clouds are thin, white and feathery.", "Cumulus clouds are a type of cloud.", "The clouds are fluffy.", "A cumulonimbus cloud is a dense, towering vertical cloud, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents.", "They are cirrocumulus clouds.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are heavy, dense, and vertically developed.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are large, towering vertical clouds that are associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability.", "A cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are heavy, dense, and involved in thunderstorms and other intense weather. They are the tallest clouds, with tops that can reach the stratosphere, more than 10 miles (16 km) high.", "Cumulus clouds are the puffy, white clouds that look like floating cotton balls in the sky.", "Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as \"fluffy\" in appearance.", "Cirrus clouds are wispy and delicate, and are composed of ice crystals.", "Clouds are masses of water droplets, ice crystals, or a mixture of both, suspended in the atmosphere above the Earth.", "Clouds are a visible mass of water droplets or frozen ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.", "Cumulus clouds are puffy, with flat bases and domed tops. They are often described as looking like pieces of floating cotton.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are heavy, dense, and vertically developed. They bring thunderstorms, lightning, heavy rain, and sometimes hail.", "Cumulus clouds are puffy clouds. They are often described as cotton balls.", "Cumulus clouds are white, puffy clouds that look like floating cotton balls in the sky. They are often called fair-weather clouds because they are frequently seen on sunny days.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are the most dangerous type of cloud.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are a dense, towering vertical cloud associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents.", "A cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are the tallest of all cloud types, rising as high as the tropopause, and form the basis of severe thunderstorms and many of the world's most severe weather phenomena.", "The clouds are made of water droplets or ice crystals.", "There are three types of clouds: cumulus, stratus, and cirrus.", "Clouds are formed when water vapor cools and condenses into droplets or ice crystals, which are suspended in the atmosphere.", "Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that often have a wave like appearance.", "Cumulus clouds are white and fluffy clouds that look like cotton balls.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are a dense and vertically developed cloud that produces thunderstorms.", "Clouds are a visible mass of droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.", "These clouds are called cumulus.", "Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that typically appear in fair weather.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are dark, dense, and vertical clouds that produce thunderstorms.", "Stratus clouds are low-level clouds that are flat and layered. They are usually gray or white and are often mistaken for fog. Stratus clouds are usually associated with light precipitation.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are large, dense, and vertically developed. They bring heavy precipitation, hail, lightning, and strong winds.", "Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as \"fluffy\" in appearance. They are often white, but may be of any color.", "There are three main types of clouds: cirrus, stratus, and cumulus.", "Cumulus clouds are white, fluffy clouds that look like floating cotton balls in the sky.", "Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that are often white in color and are composed of ice crystals.", "Cumulonimbus clouds are a dense, towering vertical cloud, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents."]
