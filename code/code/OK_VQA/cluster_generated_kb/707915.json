["Kites are tethered flying objects which fly by using aerodynamic lift, requiring wind, (or towing), for generation of airflow over the lifting surfaces.", "A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it.", "These are stunt kites.", "A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag.
