["The size of the body of water is an indication of whether it is a lake or an ocean. Lakes are typically smaller than oceans and have a more defined shoreline. Additionally, the presence of boats or other vessels is often an indication that the body of water is a lake or river.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge suggest that this is a lake, as small boats and bridges are not typically found in oceans.", "Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water than oceans and are often surrounded by land. Lakes typically have still or slow-moving water, while oceans typically have large waves and strong currents.", "The size of the body of water is a key indicator of whether it is a lake or an ocean. Lakes tend to be smaller than oceans, and the presence of a bridge over the water is another clue that the body of water is a lake.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge would indicate that this is a lake, as oceans are too large to have such features.", "The presence of a bridge and the small size of the boats suggests that this is a lake rather than an ocean.", "The presence of a bridge and small boats would suggest that this is a lake rather than an ocean, as bridges are not typically built over oceans and the boats are too small to traverse the open sea.", "The presence of a bridge and the small size of the boats suggests that this is a lake rather than an ocean. Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water than oceans and are often crossed by bridges.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge suggest that the body of water is a lake, as lakes are typically smaller in size than oceans and can be traversed by small boats or crossed by bridges.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge over the body of water suggest that it is a lake and not an ocean. Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water that are not connected to larger bodies of water, such as oceans.", "The presence of small boats on the water is a good indication that this is a lake, as small boats are typically not used in the open ocean due to the large waves and dangerous conditions. Additionally, the presence of a bridge over the body of water is another indication that this is a lake, as bridges are not typically constructed over the open ocean.", "The presence of a bridge and small boats suggest that the body of water is a lake, as opposed to an ocean, which would not have a bridge crossing it.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge suggests that this is a lake, as oceans are too large and deep for these vessels and structures.", "Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water than oceans, and they are usually surrounded by land. Lakes also tend to have more still water than oceans, which usually have waves.", "Lakes are usually much smaller than oceans and have less wave action. They are often surrounded by land, while oceans are not.", "Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water than oceans, and they are usually surrounded by land. Oceans, on the other hand, are much larger and have no land boundaries. Additionally, the presence of small boats and a bridge suggest that this is a lake, as these features are usually not found in oceans.", "We can suspect that this is a lake and not an ocean because of the small size of the boats, the presence of a bridge, and the fact that the body of water is relatively calm and still.", "The presence of small boats and a small bridge suggest that this is likely a lake, as opposed to an ocean which would be too large to have a bridge crossing it. Additionally, the presence of a body of water at sunrise and sunset suggests that this is a smaller body of water, such as a lake.", "The size of the body of water, the presence of small boats, and the presence of a bridge are all indicators that this is likely a lake rather than an ocean.", "Lakes are usually smaller than oceans and are usually surrounded by land. Lakes also tend to be calmer and less turbulent than oceans.", "The size of the body of water and the presence of small boats suggest that this is a lake rather than an ocean. Lakes are generally smaller and shallower than oceans, and are often surrounded by land.", "A lake is typically smaller and more contained than an ocean, and the presence of a bridge and small boats suggest that this body of water is a lake.", "The presence of the small boats, bridge, and shoreline are indicators that this body of water is likely a lake, rather than an ocean.", "The presence of a bridge and small boats are indicators that this is likely a lake and not an ocean. Lakes are typically smaller bodies of water and are usually surrounded by land, whereas oceans are much larger bodies of water that are connected to other oceans.", "The presence of small boats and a bridge suggests that this is a lake and not an ocean, as the size of the boats and the bridge would not be able to withstand the power of the ocean waves."]
