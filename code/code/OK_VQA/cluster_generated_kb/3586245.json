["The property of reflectivity allows light to bounce off the surface of an object, which is what allows images to be seen on an object's surface.", "The property is called reflection. Reflection is the process of light bouncing off a surface and reflecting back to the viewer.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is known as reflectivity. Reflectivity is the ability of an object to reflect light, and is determined by the material's composition and surface characteristics.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflectivity. Reflectivity is the amount of light that is reflected off of a surface.", "The property of reflection allows images to be seen on an object's surface. When light is reflected off of an object, it is bounced off in the same direction as the incident light. This is what allows us to see the images on the ornament.", "The property is called reflectivity. Reflectivity is the ability of a surface to reflect light.", "The property is called reflection, which is the bouncing back of light from a surface.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection. Reflection is when light bounces off an object's surface, creating an image.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflectivity. Reflectivity is the ability of a material to reflect light.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection. Reflection is the bouncing of light off a surface, which allows us to see the shape and color of the object.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection. When light hits an object, some of the light is reflected, allowing the object to be seen.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflectivity. The more reflective an object is, the more light it will reflect and the clearer the image will be.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflectivity. Reflectivity is the ability of a surface to reflect light or other forms of radiation.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection.", "The property is called reflectivity, which is the ability of a surface to reflect light.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection. Reflection occurs when light bounces off of the object's surface and is then seen by the viewer.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection.", "The property is called reflection.

Reflectivity is the ability of a surface to reflect light back to its source.", "The property is called reflection. Light reflects off the surface of the object and is seen by the viewer.", "The property is called reflection. Reflection is when light bounces off a surface and is seen by an observer.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is called reflection. Reflection occurs when light bounces off of a surface and is then reflected back to the viewer's eyes, allowing them to see the image on the object's surface.", "The property that allows images to be seen on an object's surface is known as reflectivity. Reflectivity is the ability of an object to reflect light. When light is reflected off an object, it creates an image that can be seen by the viewer.", "The property of reflection allows images to be seen on the surface of an object."]
