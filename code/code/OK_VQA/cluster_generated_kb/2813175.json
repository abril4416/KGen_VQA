["The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long-exposure photography, which captures the movement of the lights over a period of time.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by the long exposure of the camera. The camera captures the light from the traffic lights as it moves and creates a halo effect around the lights.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography. This is when the camera shutter is left open for a longer period of time, allowing more light to enter the camera, making the lights appear brighter and creating a halo effect around them.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long-exposure photography. When the shutter is open for a long period of time, the light from the traffic lights will be captured and create a halo effect around the lights.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by the long exposure of the camera's shutter, which captures the light from the traffic lights as they cycle through their colors.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography. This is when the camera shutter is open for a longer period of time, allowing more light to enter the camera and create the light trails.", "The cause of the auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night is due to long exposure photography. When the camera shutter is open for a longer period of time, the light from the traffic lights is captured and creates a halo or aura around the lights.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography. The camera's shutter is left open for a longer period of time, allowing the camera to capture the light trails from passing cars and the street lights.", "A camera's long exposure time can cause auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night. This is due to the camera's shutter staying open for a longer period of time, allowing more light to enter the camera and create a halo effect around the light source.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure to light. As the camera's shutter is open for a longer period of time, the light from the traffic lights is captured and creates a halo effect.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography, which allows more light to be captured by the camera's sensor. This light is then blended together to create the effect of a halo or aura around the traffic lights.", "Auroras around traffic lights are caused by long exposure photography. The camera is left open for a long period of time while the traffic lights are on, and the result is a bright streak of light that appears around the traffic lights. This is caused by the camera's sensitivity to the light from the traffic lights.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long-exposure photography, which captures the motion of the lights over time.", "Auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by a phenomenon known as \"light painting\" or \"light graffiti\". This is when the camera's shutter is left open for an extended period of time, allowing the light from the traffic lights to be captured and create the aura effect.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by the long exposure of the camera to the light. The camera captures the light as it moves across the frame, creating a streak of light.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night is caused by the long exposure of the camera. The camera captures the light from the traffic lights as it moves around, creating a halo effect.", "The auras seen in night photos are caused by the long exposure of the camera's shutter. When the shutter is open for a long period of time, the light from the traffic lights and street lights is captured and creates a halo effect.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by light refraction, which is the bending of light as it passes through different mediums. This is caused by the glass lenses of the traffic lights, which refract the light in different directions.", "The auras around traffic lights in photos taken at night are caused by the camera's long exposure time, which captures the light from the traffic lights as they cycle through their colors.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography. When a camera is set to a long exposure, the camera takes in more light than normal, which causes the street lights to appear as auras in the photos.", "Aura around traffic lights when photos are taken at night is caused by light refraction from the lens of the camera.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by the long exposure of the camera to the light. This causes the light to appear to be brighter and more vivid than it actually is.", "Light trails are the result of long exposure photography, where the camera shutter is left open for a longer period of time. This allows the light from the traffic lights to create a trail of light on the image.", "The auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by long exposure photography, which allows the camera to capture the light trails of the moving vehicles.", "Aura around traffic lights when photos are taken at night is caused by the long exposure of the camera to the light, which causes the light to appear to be in multiple colors."]
