["The skier leading the group is likely going the fastest, as they are in the front and setting the pace for the others.", "The skier who is leading the group is likely going the fastest, as they are in front and setting the pace for the rest of the group.", "The skier in the lead is likely going the fastest, as they are the one setting the pace for the group.", "The skier who is going fastest is the one who is closest to the bottom of the hill and has the least amount of time to slow down before reaching the bottom.", "The skier who is going the fastest will likely be the one who is closest to the bottom of the slope. The speed of the skier will also depend on their skill level and the terrain of the slope.", "The skier in the front of the group is likely going the fastest, as they have the least amount of resistance from the other skiers in the group.", "The skier who is going the fastest is the one who is leading the group. They are likely the most experienced skier and have the best technique, allowing them to go faster than the other skiers.", "The skier in the front of the group appears to be going the fastest, as they have the most momentum and are the furthest ahead of the other skiers.", "It is difficult to determine which skier is going the fastest without more information. Factors such as weight, skill level, and equipment can all affect a skier's speed.", "The skier in the lead is typically the one going the fastest. The other skiers are following behind and keeping up with the leader.", "The skier who is leading the group is likely going the fastest, as they are in the front and have the most momentum.", "The skier in the lead is likely going the fastest, as they are in front of the group and have the most momentum.", "The skier in the front of the group is likely going the fastest, as they have the least amount of resistance from the other skiers.", "It is difficult to determine which skier is going fastest without knowing the speed of each skier. However, it is likely that the skier in the lead is going the fastest.", "It is difficult to determine which skier is going fastest without knowing the speed of each skier. The skier in the lead may be going the fastest, but it is also possible that the skiers behind them are going faster."]
