Fisheye lenses are often used to capture unique perspectives and to create a sense of distortion and depth.", "The distorted look was achieved by using a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that captures a circular image with a wide field of view.", "The type of lens used to give this particular photo the distorted look is a fisheye lens. Fisheye lenses are wide-angle lenses that produce an image with a strong visual distortion, making the scene appear curved and stretched out.", "The photo was likely taken with a fisheye lens, which gives the image a distorted and curved look. Fisheye lenses are typically used to capture wide-angle shots and have a very wide field of view.", "The photo was likely taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces an image with a distorted, curved perspective. The fisheye lens gives photos a unique, fish-eye view and is often used to capture expansive landscapes and cityscapes.", "This photo was taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces a circular image with a distorted, curved look.", "This photo was taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces an image with a distorted, curved, fish-eye effect.", "The photo was likely taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces an extremely distorted image with a wide field of view.", "This photo was likely taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces a distorted, curved image.", "This photo was likely taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens with a very short focal length that produces a distorted, circular image. Fisheye lenses are often used to capture a wide field of view with an exaggerated perspective.", "The photo was taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that gives a distorted, fish-eye view of the scene.", "The photo was taken with a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that has a 180-degree field of view. The lens creates a distorted, circular image, giving the photo a unique look.", "The distorted look of this photo was achieved by using a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that captures an extremely wide, hemispherical image.", "The type of lens used to give the photo the distorted look is a fisheye lens, which is a wide-angle lens that produces a circular image with a distorted effect."]
