["The higher number on the monitor is typically the heart rate, which is measured in beats per minute (BPM). The lower number is usually the oxygen saturation level, which is measured as a percentage.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is the heart rate monitor.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is likely the heart rate, as it is being monitored for the individual laying down.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is the heart rate. Heart rate is typically measured in beats per minute (BPM) and is an indication of how hard the heart is working.", "The higher number on the monitor is likely the heart rate, which is usually measured in beats per minute.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is likely the heart rate. Heart rate is typically measured in beats per minute (BPM) and is displayed as a number on the monitor.", "The number on the top of the monitor is likely the heart rate, and the number on the bottom of the monitor is likely the oxygen saturation level. The heart rate should be higher than the oxygen saturation level.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is the heart rate. The heart rate is usually measured in beats per minute (BPM) and is typically higher than the number on the computer monitor, which is usually a measure of the computer's performance.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is the heart rate.", "The number on the monitor that is higher would depend on the type of monitor being used. For example, if the monitor is a heart rate monitor, then the number that is higher would be the heart rate. If it is a blood pressure monitor, then the higher number would be the blood pressure reading.", "The higher number on the monitor is the heart rate, which is typically measured in beats per minute.", "The number on the monitor that is higher indicates the patient's heart rate. The higher the number, the faster the patient's heart rate.", "The number on the monitor that is higher is likely the heart rate, as it is being monitored by the hospital wardle.", "The higher number on the monitor is the heart rate, which is typically measured in beats per minute (BPM).", "The number on the monitor that is higher is the heart rate, as this number will typically be higher than the other readings on the monitor."]
