["Candles produce light through a process called combustion, in which a wick is lit and the heat from the flame melts the wax. The melted wax is then vaporized, and the heat and light from the flame combine to produce the glow of the candle.", "The heat of the flame melts the wax and vaporizes the liquid inside the candle, which is then drawn up the wick and burned. This combustion process produces heat, light, and smoke.", "The heat from the flame of the candle is what helps the candle to glow.", "Candles need oxygen to burn. The oxygen combines with the wax and the wick to create a flame.", "The candles are lit by the flame of the lighter or match. The heat from the flame causes the wax of the candle to melt and the wick to burn, which in turn produces light and heat.", "The heat produced by the burning of the wax helps the candles to glow.", "The candles are lit with a match or lighter and the heat of the flame helps the candles to glow.", "Candles produce light when the heat from the flame melts the wax, releasing the fuel that is then burned. The heat of the flame vaporizes the fuel, producing a flame that emits light and heat.", "The candles are lit with a match or lighter and the heat from the flame causes the wax to melt and the wick to burn, which produces the light and heat.", "The heat from the flame of the candle is what causes the wax to melt and the wick to burn, producing the glowing light of the candle.", "The heat from the flame of the candle is what helps to make the candle glow. The heat from the flame causes the wax to melt and the liquid wax is then vaporized which produces light.", "Candles are fueled by a combustible material such as wax or tallow. When the wick is lit, the heat generated by the flame melts the wax and causes it to vaporize, releasing heat and light.", "The candles are lit by a flame, typically from a match or lighter.", "Candles burn due to a chemical reaction between the wax and the heat of the flame. The heat of the flame melts the wax, which is then vaporized and burned.", "The candles are lit with a match or lighter and the heat from the flame helps the candles to glow.", "The heat of the flame from the wick helps the wax to melt and vaporize, which produces the light from the candle.", "The flame of the candle is fueled by the wax of the candle. The heat from the flame melts the wax, which then vaporizes and combusts to produce heat, light, and smoke.", "Candles need a heat source to burn and a wick to draw the melted wax up and create the flame. The heat source is usually the flame from the wick, which is fed by the melted wax.", "The heat from the burning wax helps the candles to glow.", "The candles are lit with a match or lighter and the heat of the flame melts the wax, which then vaporizes and combusts, producing light and heat.", "Candles are fueled by a combustible material such as wax, tallow, or paraffin. When the combustible material is lit, the heat from the flame melts the wax, releasing the heat energy from the wax, which in turn creates the light.", "The heat from the flame of the candle is what helps the candles to glow. The flame produces heat which melts the wax and vaporizes the fragrances, releasing the light and scent of the candle.", "The heat from the flame of the candle helps the wax to melt and the wick to burn, which creates the light that helps the candles to glow.", "Candles are fueled by burning wax or other combustible material. The heat from the burning wax is what causes the flame to glow.", "The heat from the flame of the candle helps the wax to melt, releasing the fuel stored in the wax which is then burned. The heat also helps the wick to burn, which helps the flame to stay lit."]
