["There is no limit to how fast you can go when using this equipment.", "Snowshoes are footwear for walking over snow. Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called \"flotation\". Snowshoeing is a form of hiking. Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings. Some modern snowshoes are similar, but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the latticework", "A snowboard is a board that usually measures between 120 and 150 cm in length.", "The average speed of a snowboarder is between 10 and 20 miles per hour.", "One can go at the speed of 20 miles per hour.", "Snowshoes allow a person to travel over snow.", "Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.", "The fastest speed on a snowboard is 254.958 km/h.", "The average speed of a snowboarder is 10-30 mph.", "Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.", "Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.", "The maximum speed of the fastest human on earth is about 27 miles per hour.", "Skiing is a means of transport using skis to glide on snow.", "A snowboard is a thin board with bindings to hold a person's feet on it.
