["A landing gear is a structure attached to an aircraft to support it when it is not flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage.", "An airplane is a vehicle that can fly.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.", "Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying animal, aircraft, or spacecraft returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the process is called alighting, although it is commonly called \"landing\", \"touchdown\" or \"splashdown\" as well.", "Aircraft are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, or by a control station on the ground or on board another vessel.", "An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.", "The plane just landed.", "An airplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations.", "The plane just landed.", "The landing gear of an aircraft is used when the aircraft is not flying, and typically includes wheels equipped with simple shock absorbers, or more advanced air/oil oleo struts, for runway and rough terrain landing.", "The plane is landing.", "The plane is landing.", "A plane is an object with a flat surface that extends in all directions.", "A plane is a flat or level surface.", "A plane just landed.", "An airplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine.", "An airplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine.", "The plane just landed.", "The landing gear is the undercarriage of an aircraft or spacecraft and may be used for either takeoff or landing.", "The plane just landed.", "The plane just took off.", "A plane is flying through the air.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.", "The plane just took off.", "The plane just landed.", "The plane landed.", "An airplane lands.", "The crew of an aircraft is the group of people who operate the aircraft.", "The plane just landed.", "The plane just landed.", "An airplane or aeroplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller.", "An airplane or aeroplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller.", "An airplane or aeroplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine.", "The plane just landed.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends indefinitely in two dimensions.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.", "The plane just landed.", "The plane landed.", "The wheels are down and the plane is ready to land.", "An airplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller.", "The plane just landed.", "The airplane is landing.", "The plane just landed.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely far.", "The plane just landed.", "The airplane is landing.", "The plane just landed.", "An airplane or aeroplane is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine.", "A plane is a plane, of course, of course", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in two dimensions."]
