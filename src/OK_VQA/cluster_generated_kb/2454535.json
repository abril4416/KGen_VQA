["Benjamin Franklin famously conducted his famous kite experiment in a thunderstorm in 1752 to prove that lightning was electricity. He flew a kite in the rain with a metal key attached to the kite string, which allowed him to capture the electricity from the lightning and prove his hypothesis.", "Benjamin Franklin is credited with conducting the famous kite experiment in the rain in 1752 in the name of science.", "Benjamin Franklin famously conducted his famous kite experiment in 1752 to prove that lightning is a form of electricity.
