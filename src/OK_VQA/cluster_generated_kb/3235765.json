["Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean or sea. The friction of the wind on the water causes the water to move in circular patterns, creating ripples and eventually, waves.", "Waves are caused by the movement of energy through the ocean, usually from the wind. The wind creates friction on the surface of the water, which causes waves to form.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean. The friction between the wind and the water causes the water to move in circular patterns, creating waves.", "The waves in the background are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water, creating ripples and waves.", "The waves in the background are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean.", "The waves are caused by wind blowing across the ocean's surface.", "Waves in the ocean are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the water.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the water. The wind creates ripples in the water, which then become larger waves as they travel farther from the source.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the water.", "Waves in the ocean are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the water, which transfers some of its energy to the water and creates ripples. The size of the waves depends on the strength of the wind and the length of time it has been blowing.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the water, creating ripples and small waves.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean. The energy from the wind is transferred to the surface of the water, creating ripples that eventually form waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water, creating a ripple effect. The size and shape of the waves depend on the strength and direction of the wind, as well as the depth of the water.", "The waves in the background are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water.", "Waves are created by wind blowing across the surface of the water. The energy transferred from the wind to the water creates ripples that travel in the direction of the wind.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water, creating ripples that eventually build up into larger waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water. The friction between the wind and the water causes small ripples which gradually grow into larger waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water. The friction between the air and the water creates ripples on the surface, which then turn into waves.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the water, causing friction and creating ripples.", "The waves in the background are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean, causing friction on the water which creates ripples and eventually waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water.", "The waves in the background are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the water. The friction between the air and the water causes the water to move in circular patterns, creating waves.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the water, creating a disturbance that propagates outward in all directions."]
