["The number of speeds on a bicycle depends on the type of bike. Some bikes have one speed, while others have multiple speeds ranging from 3 to 27 speeds.", "The number of speeds a bike has depends on the type of bike. Some bikes have single speed, 3-speed, 7-speed, 18-speed, or even more speeds.", "The number of speeds a bike has depends on the type of bike. A typical mountain bike will have 21 or more speeds, while a typical road bike will have 18 or more speeds.", "The number of speeds on a bicycle varies depending on the type of bike. Some bikes have single speed, 3-speed, 6-speed, 18-speed, 21-speed, or 24-speed.", "The number of speeds on a bike can vary depending on the type of bike and the components used. Generally, most bikes have between 3-27 speeds.", "The number of speeds on a bike depends on the type of bike and the components used. Generally, most modern bikes have between 7 and 27 speeds.", "Most modern bikes have between 18 and 27 speeds, depending on the type of bike.", "The number of speeds the bike has depends on the type of bike. Some bikes have single-speed, 3-speed, 7-speed, and 21-speed.", "Most modern bicycles have between 7 and 27 speeds, depending on the type of bike and the components used.", "The number of speeds on a bicycle depends on the type of bike. Generally, mountain bikes have between 18 and 27 speeds, hybrid bikes have between 21 and 24 speeds, and road bikes have between 14 and 30 speeds.", "Bikes are typically available with multiple speeds, ranging from single-speed to 20 speeds or more.", "The number of speeds on the bike depends on the type of bike. Some bikes have single-speed, three-speed, seven-speed, or even twenty-one-speed drivetrains.", "Most modern bikes have either 18, 21, 24, 27 or 30 speeds, with the number of speeds determined by the number of gears on the bike.", "The number of speeds on a bicycle can vary depending on the type of bike. Some bikes have multiple speeds, such as 18 or 21 speeds, while others may only have one or two speeds.", "The number of speeds on a bicycle is determined by the number of gears on the bike. Most modern bikes have between 7 and 27 gears.", "The bike has a 7-speed gear system, allowing riders to adjust their speed depending on the terrain and their level of exertion.", "The number of speeds on a bike depends on the type of bike and the components it is equipped with. Bikes can have anywhere from 1 to 30 speeds.", "The number of speeds a bike has depends on the type of bike and the drivetrain components. Road bikes typically have between 16 and 27 speeds, while mountain bikes usually have between 21 and 30 speeds.", "Most modern bikes have either 7 or 21 speeds, although there are some models with more or fewer speeds.", "Most modern bicycles have between 3 to 30 gears, depending on the type of bike. Mountain bikes typically have between 18 and 30 gears, while road bikes typically have between 2 and 12 gears.", "Most modern bicycles have either 21, 24, 27, or 30 speeds. The number of speeds a bike has is determined by multiplying the number of gears in the front by the number of gears on the back wheel.", "The number of speeds a bike has depends on the type of bike. Some bikes have single speed, 3-speed, 7-speed, 8-speed, 18-speed, 21-speed, and 24-speed.", "Most modern bicycles have between 3 and 27 speeds, depending on the type of bike and the components used.", "The number of speeds a bike has depends on the type of bike. A typical mountain bike may have 21 speeds, while a road bike may have up to 27 speeds.", "Most modern bikes have between 7 and 18 speeds, depending on the type of bike and the manufacturer."]
