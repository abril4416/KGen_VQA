["The CO2 emissions of that bus depend on the make, model, and year of the vehicle. Generally, newer buses are more fuel-efficient and produce lower CO2 emissions than older models.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on its engine size and fuel type. Most buses use diesel engines, which emit more CO2 than gasoline engines. The average CO2 emissions of a diesel bus range from 0.3 to 0.4 pounds per mile.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on its size, engine type, and fuel type.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on its size, engine type, and fuel type. Generally, larger buses with diesel engines emit more CO2 than smaller buses with gasoline engines.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on the size and fuel type of the vehicle. Generally, buses powered by diesel engines emit between 0.3 and 0.4 kilograms of CO2 per kilometer.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on the size of the bus, the type of fuel used, and the efficiency of the engine. Generally, buses emit between 0.3 and 0.4 kilograms of CO2 per kilometer traveled.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on many factors, such as the type of engine, the fuel used, and the size of the bus. Generally, a bus with an internal combustion engine will produce more CO2 than a bus with an electric engine.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on the size and type of bus, the engine, and the fuel type. Generally, buses emit around 0.2 to 0.4 kg of CO2 per kilometer traveled.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on its size and fuel type. A standard bus powered by diesel typically has a CO2 emission rate of around 180-220 grams per kilometer.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on the type of bus, its fuel type, and its age. Generally, the newer the bus, the lower its CO2 emissions.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on its engine size, fuel type, and age. Generally, buses with larger engines and older models will have higher emissions than those with smaller engines and newer models.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on the type of engine, fuel, and driving conditions.", "The average CO2 emissions of a diesel bus are around 0.3 kg per kilometer, while the average CO2 emissions of a gasoline bus are around 0.4 kg per kilometer. The emissions of a bus depend on the engine type, size, and fuel type.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on the type and size of the engine, the type of fuel used, and the efficiency of the emissions control system. Generally, buses with diesel engines have higher emissions than those with gasoline engines.", "The average CO2 emissions of a red bus are approximately 180-200 grams of CO2 per kilometer.", "The CO2 emissions of a typical red bus are approximately 0.25 kg per passenger kilometer.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on its size and type of engine. Generally, buses with diesel engines have higher CO2 emissions than buses with gasoline engines.", "The average CO2 emissions of a passenger bus is approximately 0.3 kg of CO2 per kilometer.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus depend on the type of engine it has, the size of the bus, and other factors. Generally, the average CO2 emissions of a bus are around 200-300 g/km.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus will depend on the engine size and type, as well as the fuel type. Generally, diesel buses will have higher CO2 emissions than gasoline buses.", "The CO2 emissions of a red bus vary depending on the make and model. Generally, the emissions of a standard bus range from 0.19 to 0.39 pounds of CO2 per mile.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus are estimated to be around 115 g/km.", "The average CO2 emissions of a standard bus is between 5.3 and 6.2 metric tons per year.", "The CO2 emissions of the bus depend on the type of engine and the size of the vehicle.", "The CO2 emissions of a bus vary depending on the type of engine and the fuel used. Generally, diesel buses have higher CO2 emissions than buses powered by natural gas, electric or hybrid engines."]
