["Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean. The energy of the wind is transferred to the water, creating ripples that grow into larger waves as they travel away from the source.", "Waves are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean or lake, transferring energy from the air to the water. The size of the waves depends on the strength of the wind, the length of time it has been blowing, and the distance over which it has traveled.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. As the wind blows, it creates ripples on the surface of the water that eventually turn into larger waves. The size of the wave depends on the strength of the wind and the distance it has traveled over the water.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean. The wind causes the surface of the water to become rough, which in turn creates waves.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy from the wind is transferred to the water, creating ripples that eventually form waves.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy from the wind transfers to the water, creating ripples and eventually larger waves.", "Waves are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy from the wind is transferred to the water, creating ripples that grow into larger waves.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The wind creates ripples on the water's surface, which eventually form into waves.", "Waves are caused by winds blowing over the surface of the ocean, creating areas of high and low pressure.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the ocean surface, creating ripples of energy that move across the ocean.", "Waves are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The wind transfers energy from the atmosphere to the ocean, creating waves that can range in size from small ripples to large swells.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean, creating areas of high and low pressure. The energy from the wind is transferred to the water, creating ripples and waves that can be seen and felt.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the water, creating ripples that eventually form larger waves.", "Surfable waves are typically formed by wind moving over the surface of the sea, and the friction between the wind and the surface of the sea causes the water to form waves.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the water. The wind transfers energy from the atmosphere to the ocean, creating ripples on the surface of the water. As the wind continues to blow, these ripples grow into larger and larger waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean, creating friction and turbulence which then transfers energy to the water, forming a wave.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean, creating a swell that travels across the ocean and eventually breaks on the shore.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing over the surface of the water, transferring energy from the air to the water. The size and shape of the wave depends on the strength and duration of the wind, and the distance it has traveled over the water.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy of the wind is transferred to the water, creating an area of high pressure in front of the wind and an area of low pressure behind it. This causes the water to rise up and form a wave.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy from the wind is transferred to the water, creating swells and ripples on the surface. As the waves travel, they grow in size and power, eventually reaching the shore.", "Waves are caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. As the wind travels across the ocean, it transfers energy to the water, creating ripples and eventually larger waves.", "Waves are created by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean.", "Waves are created by wind blowing across the surface of the water, causing ripples and eventually larger waves.", "Waves are caused by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean.", "Waves are caused by winds blowing across the surface of the ocean, creating ripples that eventually become larger swells. The size and shape of the wave depend on the strength and duration of the wind, the depth of the water, and the distance over which the wind has blown."]
