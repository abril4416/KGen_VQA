["The wind strength needed to fly a kite depends on the size, shape, and weight of the kite. Generally, a wind speed of 4 to 10 mph is needed for kite flying.", "The strength of the wind needed for kite flying depends on the size and type of kite. Generally, winds of 5-15 mph are ideal for kite flying.", "The wind strength needed for kite flying depends on the type of kite. Generally, winds of 5-20 mph are ideal for flying kites.", "The wind was strong enough to lift the kites and keep them airborne.", "Kite flying requires winds of at least 8-10 mph for the kite to stay aloft.", "The wind speed for kite flying is usually between 5 and 25 mph.", "The wind strength at the beach will depend on the location and season. Generally, the wind at the beach can range from light to strong, with an average wind speed of 4 to 16 mph.", "The wind was moderate to strong.", "The wind was strong enough to lift the kites into the sky.", "The wind must have been strong enough to lift the kites into the air, but not too strong that it would be dangerous to fly them.", "Kites fly best in winds of 8 to 20 mph.", "The wind strength at the beach is determined by the Beaufort scale, which ranges from 0 (calm) to 12 (hurricane). The strength of the wind will vary depending on the time of day, the season, and the location.", "The wind strength can be determined by observing the speed of the kites flying overhead.", "The strength of the wind needed to fly a kite depends on the size and shape of the kite, as well as the density of the air. Generally, winds of 5-15 mph are ideal for kite flying.", "The wind strength can vary depending on the location, season, and time of day. Generally, a wind strength of 5-15 mph is considered ideal for flying kites.", "The strength of the wind is measured by its speed, or how fast it is blowing. The speed of the wind is measured in miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per hour (kph).", "Kite flying requires a steady wind of at least 4 to 5 mph (6 to 8 km/h).", "The wind strength necessary to fly a kite is typically between 5 and 25 miles per hour.", "The strength of the wind depends on the location and time of day.", "The wind strength necessary to fly a kite depends on the size and design of the kite. Generally, a wind speed of between 5 and 15 mph is needed to fly a kite.", "The wind strength on a beach can range from light breezes to strong gusts, depending on the weather conditions. On a clear day, the wind can be very strong, while on a cloudy day it can be much calmer.", "The wind was strong enough to lift the kites into the air, but not too strong to make it difficult to fly the kites.", "The wind strength depends on the location, season, and time of day. Generally, kite flying requires wind speeds of at least 8-10 mph.", "The wind on a beach is usually between 5-15 mph.", "The wind was strong enough to lift the kites into the air. The wind was blowing at a speed of around 10-15 mph."]
