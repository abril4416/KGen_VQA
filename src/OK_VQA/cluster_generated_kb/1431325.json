["The remote toy is a type of radio-controlled toy that is operated by a hand-held transmitter. The transmitter sends signals to the toy, which then responds by moving in a certain direction or performing certain actions.", "Remote control toys work by transmitting signals from the remote control to the toy. The signals are received by a receiver on the toy, which then activates the toy's motors or other components to perform the desired action.", "Remote controlled toys are powered by batteries and use a radio controller to send signals to the toy. The controller sends signals to the toy which then responds with the appropriate action. The toy can move, make sounds, and even perform other functions depending on the type of toy.", "Remote toys work by using radio frequencies to control the toy from a distance. The remote sends out signals to the toy, which then responds to the commands.", "The remote toy works by using radio frequency signals to control the movement of the toy. The signals are sent from the remote control to the toy, which then responds by moving in the desired direction. The wet mattress is used to provide a soft landing surface for the boy in case he falls while playing with the toy. The building blocks are used to construct structures and objects.", "The remote toy works by connecting to a control unit that can be operated by a remote control. The control unit is programmed to respond to the buttons on the remote control, allowing the user to control the toy's movements.", "The remote toy is a radio-controlled device that can be operated from a distance using a transmitter. The transmitter sends signals to the toy, which responds by moving in a certain direction.", "The remote control toy is operated by a remote control which sends signals to the toy, allowing it to move in different directions.", "The remote control toy is operated by a transmitter which sends signals to a receiver on the toy, allowing it to move in different directions.", "The remote control toy works by sending signals from the remote control to the toy, which then responds by performing the desired action.", "The remote control toy works by using a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter sends out a signal that is picked up by the receiver, which then controls the movement of the toy.", "Remote control toys are operated by a handheld device that transmits signals to a receiver built into the toy. The receiver translates the signal into action, causing the toy to move or perform a specific action.", "Remote control toys work by sending radio signals from the controller to a receiver on the toy. The receiver then interprets the signal and causes the toy to move or perform an action.", "Remote control toys work by using a transmitter to send a signal to a receiver on the toy. The signal is then processed by the toy's internal circuitry, which causes it to move or perform an action.", "The inflatable pit is filled with air and the boy is using the remote control to maneuver the toy around the pit. The wet mattress provides a soft surface for the boy to stand on. The building blocks are used to create structures and designs.", "This remote-controlled toy works by using a transmitter to send signals to the toy's receiver. The receiver then interprets the signals and moves the toy accordingly.", "Remote control toys use radio signals to control the movement of the toy. The remote control sends a signal to a receiver on the toy, which then activates the motors in the toy allowing it to move.", "The remote control toy works by using radio waves to transmit signals from the remote control to the toy. The signals cause the toy to move in the direction that the user has selected.", "Remote control toys are operated by a handheld remote control device that transmits signals to the toy, allowing it to be controlled remotely. The remote control device typically contains buttons, joysticks, and other control mechanisms that allow the user to control the toy's movements and/or functions.", "Remote control toys are operated by a transmitter that sends signals to a receiver on the toy. The receiver then interprets the signals and causes the toy to move in response.", "Remote control toys work by using radio waves to transmit a signal from the controller to the toy, which then responds by moving or performing an action.", "The inflatable pit is a type of toy that is filled with air and can be used for bouncing, sliding, and playing. The remote toy is a type of toy that is controlled by a remote control and can move around on its own. The building blocks are a type of toy that can be used to construct different structures.", "The remote control toy works by responding to signals from a handheld remote control. The remote control sends signals to the toy, which then moves or performs the desired action.", "Remote control toys are toys that can be controlled by remote or radio signals from a distance. They are powered by batteries and use electric motors to move around.", "The remote toy works by the boy using a remote control to move the toy around the inflatable pit. The wet mattress is used for cushioning and safety. The building blocks are used to construct various shapes."]
