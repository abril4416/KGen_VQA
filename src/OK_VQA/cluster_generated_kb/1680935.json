Waves are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the water, causing it to swell and form a crest.", "The water is forming a wave, which is a ridge or swell on the surface of a body of water, typically caused by the wind.", "The shape of the wave is determined by the shape of the seafloor. The wave is usually an arching shape, called a crest, which is created by the energy of the wave pushing the water up. The trough, or lowest point of the wave, is created when the wave's energy is dissipated.", "The water is forming a wave, which is a disturbance that travels through a medium, such as water or air.", "The water is making a wave, which is a moving ridge or swell on the surface of a body of water, typically caused by the wind.", "The water is making a wave, which is a disturbance that propagates through space and time, usually in the form of an oscillation.", "The shape of the water is called a wave. Waves are created by wind blowing over the surface of the water.", "The water is making a wave shape.", "The water is forming a curl or tube shape as the wave breaks.", "The water is forming a wave, which is a moving ridge or swell on the surface of a body of water, typically caused by the wind.", "The water is making a wave.", "The water is forming a wave.", "The water is forming a wave, which is a moving ridge or swell on the surface of a body of water, typically caused by the wind.", "The water is making a wave shape. Waves are created when energy is transferred through the water, causing it to move in a circular motion. The size and shape of the wave depends on the energy of the wave and the depth of the water."]
