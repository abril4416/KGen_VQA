["Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from crude oil. Diesel fuel is more energy-dense than gasoline and is more efficient for large vehicles.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel. Some trucks may also use alternative fuels such as biodiesel or compressed natural gas (CNG).", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, as it is more efficient and produces more power than gasoline. Diesel fuel is a type of fuel derived from crude oil. It is composed of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds, and is used in the majority of vehicles that require a fuel source with a higher energy density than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, although some may use alternative fuels such as natural gas or propane.", "The most common type of fuel used in large trucks is diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is a type of fuel derived from petroleum that is designed to be used in diesel engines. It is a highly efficient fuel that is capable of providing a great deal of power and torque, making it ideal for large, heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, as diesel engines are more efficient and powerful than gasoline engines.", "Most modern dump trucks use diesel fuel, as diesel engines provide more power and torque than gasoline engines.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, although some newer models may use alternative fuels such as natural gas, propane, or electric power.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, as it is more efficient and powerful than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is more efficient and provides more power than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, as it is more efficient and provides better performance than gasoline. Diesel engines are designed to burn the fuel more efficiently, resulting in better fuel economy and lower emissions.", "The type of fuel used by this vehicle depends on the make and model, but typically diesel fuel is used in large trucks.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is more efficient and has more power than standard gasoline. Diesel fuel is also more cost-effective and produces fewer emissions than gasoline.", "This type of truck typically uses diesel fuel.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from petroleum. Diesel fuel is a more efficient fuel than gasoline and is less flammable, making it a safer choice for large vehicles. Diesel fuel is also more cost-effective than gasoline, making it a popular choice for truck owners and operators.", "Most diesel trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from crude oil. Diesel fuel is a highly efficient fuel source, as it produces more energy per gallon than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from petroleum. Diesel fuel is more energy dense than gasoline and is more efficient, making it a popular choice for large trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles.", "Dump trucks typically use diesel fuel, as it is more efficient and provides better performance than gasoline. Diesel fuel is also more cost-effective and produces fewer emissions.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is more efficient and has a higher energy density than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a petroleum-based fuel that is more efficient and has more power than gasoline.", "Most large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from petroleum that is designed to provide more power and torque than gasoline. Diesel fuel is more efficient and produces fewer emissions than gasoline.", "Most modern trucks use diesel fuel, which is more efficient and produces fewer emissions than gasoline.", "Most trucks use diesel fuel, although some may use alternative fuels such as biodiesel or compressed natural gas.", "Most modern dump trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from petroleum and used in internal combustion engines. Diesel fuel is more efficient and has a higher energy density than gasoline, allowing for greater fuel economy and increased power output.", "Most modern large trucks use diesel fuel, which is a type of fuel derived from petroleum. Diesel fuel is commonly used in commercial and industrial vehicles due to its higher energy content and lower emissions than gasoline."]
