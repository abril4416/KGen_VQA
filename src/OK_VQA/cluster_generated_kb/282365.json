["Most passenger trains are powered by an electric locomotive, which draws power from an overhead wire or third rail.", "The train runs on electricity, typically supplied by overhead lines or a third rail.", "This train runs on electricity, which is generated from an external power source and sent to the train through the tracks.", "Most trains run on electricity from overhead wires, although some trains, such as diesel-electric locomotives, run on diesel fuel.", "This train runs on electric power, which is supplied by overhead wires or a third rail.", "The train runs on a railway track that is made up of two parallel steel rails, which are held in place by wooden or concrete sleepers. The train is powered by an electric motor or a diesel engine, and the wheels of the train run on the tracks.", "The train runs on electricity generated by the power station and transmitted through an overhead power line.", "The train runs on electricity, which is supplied by an overhead power line or third rail.", "Most trains are powered by electricity and run on tracks that guide the train along its route. The electricity is supplied to the train through overhead cables or a third rail system.", "This train runs on electricity, usually supplied by an overhead wire.", "The train runs on electricity, which is supplied by an overhead power line or a third rail.", "The train is powered by an electric motor and runs on an electrified rail system.", "Most trains run on a railway track, which consists of two parallel steel rails, usually laid on a bed of crushed stone. Trains are powered either by electric motors or diesel engines, and can travel at speeds of up to 200 km/h (125 mph).", "Subway trains are powered by electric motors that draw power from an overhead wire, called a third rail. The train is propelled by the electric motors, and the power is regulated by a system of switches and signals.", "The train runs on electricity, using an electric motor to power the wheels.", "The train runs on electricity supplied by an overhead line or third rail. The electricity is used to power the train's motors, which move the wheels and propel the train forward.", "Subway trains typically run on electricity, usually supplied by a third rail along the tracks.", "Trains typically run on a network of tracks, which are powered by an electric current. The electric current is generated by an engine, which is usually powered by diesel or electricity. The engine then turns a wheel, which propels the train forward.", "The train runs on electricity generated by the railway company.", "This train runs on electricity, which is generated by the power grid and supplied to the train through overhead wires or a third rail.", "This train runs on electricity, using an overhead power line to power the engine.", "Subway trains are powered by electricity and use a third rail system to transfer power to the train. The train is propelled by electric motors located inside the train car.", "This train runs on electricity, generated by the electric motor in the train. The electric motor is powered by electricity from the overhead power lines.", "Most modern trains use electric motors to power their wheels, which draw power from an overhead electrical line or a third rail. Some trains, such as diesel-electric locomotives, use a combination of diesel engines and electric motors.", "The train runs on a rail network, powered by electricity or diesel. The tracks are laid out in a network, allowing the train to travel from one destination to another."]
