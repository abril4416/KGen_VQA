["Climate change has caused a decrease in the availability of food sources for arctic mammals, leading them to swim for longer distances in search of food.", "Due to climate change, the Arctic sea ice is melting at an accelerated rate, forcing polar bears to swim for longer distances in search of food. As the sea ice melts, polar bears have to swim further to find food, leading to more instances of exhaustion and even death.", "Climate change is causing a decrease in the availability of food in the Arctic, forcing these mammals to swim for longer distances to find food.", "Climate change is causing the Arctic sea ice to melt earlier in the summer, which is forcing polar bears to swim for longer distances to find food as their traditional hunting grounds become more difficult to access.", "Due to climate change, Arctic sea ice is melting at an accelerated rate, resulting in a decrease in the availability of the species' traditional food sources, forcing them to swim longer distances in search of food.", "The changing climate is causing the sea ice to melt earlier in the year, reducing the amount of time the bears have to hunt and feed on land. This is forcing them to swim longer distances in search of food.", "Due to climate change and melting sea ice, polar bears are being forced to swim longer distances in search of food.", "Arctic mammals are swimming for longer distances to find food due to the effects of climate change, which has caused a decrease in the availability of food sources in their natural habitats.", "Climate change has caused the Arctic sea ice to melt, reducing the amount of food available to Arctic mammals. As a result, they are forced to swim longer distances to find food.", "Due to the effects of climate change, the Arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate. This has caused a decline in the availability of traditional food sources, forcing polar bears to swim for longer distances in search of food.", "Climate change is causing Arctic sea ice to melt earlier in the year, forcing polar bears to swim for longer distances in search of food.", "Climate change is causing the Arctic to warm faster than any other region on Earth, resulting in a decrease in sea ice. This is causing polar bears to swim longer distances in search of food as their traditional hunting grounds become more difficult to access.", "Due to climate change, the sea ice is melting earlier in the year and forming later, leading to a decrease in the availability of their traditional prey. This is forcing the bears to swim longer distances to find food.", "Due to climate change, Arctic sea ice is melting at an alarming rate. This is causing the animals to swim for longer distances to find food as their habitats are shrinking.", "Climate change is causing sea ice to melt earlier in the season, forcing polar bears to swim for longer distances to find food and habitat. This has caused a decrease in their population and an increase in the number of bear drownings.", "The melting of the Arctic ice due to climate change has caused polar bears to swim longer distances to find food.", "Climate change is causing the Arctic to warm faster than the rest of the planet, which is leading to a decrease in sea ice and an increase in open water. As sea ice melts, polar bears must swim for longer distances to find food, as their traditional hunting grounds become more difficult to access.", "As the climate warms, the Arctic sea ice is melting, leading to a decrease in the availability of the bears' traditional food sources such as seals and fish. As a result, the bears are forced to swim for longer distances in search of food.", "Due to climate change, sea ice is melting earlier in the year, leading to a decrease in the availability of food in the Arctic. This has resulted in polar bears having to swim for longer distances to find food.", "Global warming is causing the Arctic ice to melt, which is making it more difficult for polar bears to find food on the ice. As a result, they are being forced to swim longer distances in search of food.", "Due to climate change, sea ice is melting earlier in the season, resulting in the Arctic mammals having to swim for longer distances to find food as their traditional sources become more scarce.", "Due to climate change, Arctic sea ice is melting at an accelerated rate, causing polar bears to swim for longer distances to find food. As their sea ice habitat continues to decline, polar bears must swim further and further to find the food they need to survive.", "Due to climate change, sea ice is melting earlier in the year, which affects the availability of food for Arctic mammals. As a result, they are having to swim for longer distances to find food.", "Climate change has caused the Arctic to warm faster than the global average, leading to a decrease in sea ice and a decrease in the availability of their traditional food sources, forcing them to swim for longer distances to find food.", "The increasing temperatures in the Arctic region are causing the sea ice to melt earlier and freeze later, resulting in a shorter hunting season for these arctic mammals. As a result, they are being forced to swim longer distances in search of food."]
