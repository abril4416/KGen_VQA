["Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as water or glass, and the speed of the light changes. This causes the light to bend, or refract, and creates the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium with a different index of refraction. This causes the light to bend, and the different wavelengths of light bend at different angles, creating a spectrum of colors.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as a prism, and the speed of the light changes. This causes the light to bend and separate into the colors of the visible spectrum.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, and is bent due to the different densities of the medium. This bending of the light causes the colors of the spectrum to appear, resulting in a rainbow.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium such as glass or water and is bent in different directions. This causes the light to separate into its component colors, which is why we see a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, and is bent or \"refracted\" due to the different densities of the mediums. This bending causes the light to split into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as glass or water, and bends. This bending of light is caused by the different speeds of light in different materials. When the light bends, it splits into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction is the bending of light as it passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass. This bending of light causes the colors of the visible spectrum to separate, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air or water, and is bent due to the different densities of the mediums. This bending causes the light to split into its component colors, creating the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, glass, or other transparent material, and is bent when it encounters a different medium. This bending of the light is due to the change in the speed of light as it passes from one medium to another. The different colors of the rainbow are caused by the different wavelengths of light being bent at different angles as they pass through the medium.", "Light refraction is the bending of light as it passes through a medium, such as air, glass, or water. When light passes through these mediums, it is broken up into its component colors, which are then scattered in different directions, creating the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as glass or water, and the speed of the light changes, causing it to bend. When the light bends, it splits into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction is the bending of light as it passes through a medium. It occurs when light moves from one medium to another, such as from air to water. When light passes through a medium, it changes speed and direction. This causes the light to be bent, which produces the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction is the bending of light as it passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, due to the change in speed. This bending causes the light to separate into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as water or glass, and the speed of the light changes.

This bending is caused by the change in speed of the light as it passes through the medium. When light passes through a prism, the different wavelengths of light will bend at different angles, causing a rainbow of colors to appear.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as glass or water, and the speed of the light changes. This causes the light to bend, or refract, and create a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium and is bent due to the different speeds of light in the medium. This causes the light to separate into its component colors, which is what causes the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as water or glass, and is bent due to the change in speed. This bending of light causes the different colors of the rainbow to be seen because each color has a different wavelength.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as water or glass, and the light is bent. This bending of light causes different wavelengths of light to be bent at different angles, resulting in the appearance of a rainbow.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, and is bent due to the change in speed. This bending of light causes the colors of the rainbow to appear.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another medium of different densities, resulting in the bending of the light's path. This bending of the light causes a separation of the colors of the visible spectrum, which creates the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air or water, and is bent by the different densities of the medium. This causes the light to separate into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air or water, and is bent in different directions. As the light passes through the medium, the different wavelengths of light are bent differently, causing the rainbow effect.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air or water, and changes direction. This is due to the different speeds at which light travels through different materials. When light passes through a prism, it is refracted and separated into its component colors, which is why rainbows appear."]
