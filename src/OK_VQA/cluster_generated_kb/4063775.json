["Steam locomotive engines are powered by steam.", "Steam locomotives use steam to move.", "A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually rather referred to as multiple units, motor coaches, railcars or power cars; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter and Iron Highway).", "A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "The smoke is steam.", "A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler.", "Steam locomotives burn fuel, like coal or oil, to create steam, which moves pistons back and forth.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "Steam locomotives burn coal, which leaves a black sooty exhaust.", "Steam locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers).", "Steam locomotives produce a lot of smoke and soot because they burn large amounts of coal.", "The steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.", "Steam locomotives normally use a mixture of coal, oil, and water.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "Steam locomotives burn coal or wood to produce steam in a boiler.", "The steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler.", "The smoke is the result of the combustion of the fuel, which is usually coal, wood, or oil.", "Steam locomotives typically have a chimney at the front of the locomotive, which is usually straight and tall, and through which the exhaust steam passes before entering the chimney.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "The steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers).", "The smoke that comes out of a locomotive is not smoke, it is steam. It is steam because the locomotive is powered by a steam engine.", "The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is transformed, by a connecting rod and flywheel, into rotational force for work. The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described, not to the steam turbine.", "The steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.", "Steam locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler.

They were the main type of locomotive used on railways for over a century, from the early 19th century to the middle of the 20th century.", "The locomotive uses steam to drive a piston back and forth.", "It blows white smoke because it is a steam locomotive.", "The locomotive blows white smoke because it is burning coal.", "Steam is water in the gas phase, which is formed when water boils. Steam is invisible; however, \"steam\" often refers to wet steam, the visible mist or aerosol of water droplets formed as water vapour condenses.", "The smoke is steam.", "The locomotive is a steam locomotive.", "Steam locomotives produce smoke from the burning of fuel, which is typically coal, wood or oil.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "Steam locomotives typically emit white smoke as a result of burning fuel.", "Steam locomotives are steam-powered railway locomotives. They were the main type of locomotive used on railways for almost a hundred years from the early 19th century until dieselisation in the mid-20th century.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "The smoke is steam, which is created when the water in the boiler is heated and turns to vapor.", "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.", "Steam locomotives burn fuel, usually coal, wood or oil, to produce steam in a boiler, which drives the steam engine.", "The steam engine is a type of heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.", "Steam locomotives produce white smoke as they burn coal.", "The locomotive is a steam engine.", "Steam locomotives are powered by steam engines, and these engines are fueled by burning combustible material \u2013 usually coal, wood, or oil \u2013 to produce steam in a boiler.", "Steam locomotives often have a whistle mounted on the boiler. The steam for the whistle is taken from the dome, which is the highest point on the boiler and therefore has the highest steam pressure.", "Steam locomotives are steam-powered railway locomotives.
