["Boats are designed with buoyancy, which is the ability to float on water. This is achieved by having the boat filled with air-filled compartments that are sealed off from the water.", "The buoyancy of the boats keeps them afloat. The buoyancy is generated by the displacement of water by the hull of the boat, which causes an upward force that counters the weight of the boat and its contents.", "The boats are kept from sinking by the water-tight hulls, which are designed to keep the water out. The hulls are buoyant, meaning that they displace enough water to keep the boat afloat. Additionally, the boats may have flotation devices, such as life jackets and airtight compartments, to help keep them afloat.", "Boats are kept afloat by a combination of buoyancy, displacement, and ballast. Buoyancy is the upward force generated by the water pushing up on the boat. Displacement is the weight of the boat pushing down into the water. Ballast is the weight of the boat's hull and other components that are designed to keep it stable.", "The buoyancy of the boats helps to keep them afloat. The hull of the boat is designed to displace a certain amount of water, which helps to keep the boat from sinking.", "The boats are kept from sinking by their hulls, which are designed to displace a certain amount of water and provide buoyancy.", "The buoyancy of the boats keeps them from sinking. The buoyancy is created by the air trapped inside the boat's hull, which makes it less dense than the water.", "The hull of the boat is designed to displace enough water to stay afloat. The buoyancy of the boat is provided by the air in the sealed compartments in the hull and the buoyancy of the materials used to construct the hull.", "The buoyancy of the boats keeps them from sinking. The buoyancy of the boats is provided by the air trapped inside the hulls of the boats.", "The boats are kept afloat by a combination of buoyancy and displacement of water.", "The boats are buoyant due to the air trapped in their hulls. The air provides an upward force that counteracts the downward force of gravity, which keeps the boats from sinking.", "The boats are kept from sinking by the buoyancy of the hulls, which are designed to displace a certain amount of water, and by the watertight integrity of the hulls, which prevents water from entering the boat.", "Boats are designed with buoyancy in mind, so they stay afloat due to the displacement of water. The buoyancy of a boat is determined by its shape, size, and weight.", "The boats are kept from sinking by their hulls, which are designed to displace a certain amount of water, keeping the boat afloat. The hulls also provide buoyancy, which helps the boats stay afloat.", "The boats are kept from sinking by a combination of their buoyancy and the airtight compartments inside the hull.", "The buoyancy of the boat keeps it afloat. The buoyancy of a boat is the force that acts against the weight of the boat, allowing it to float. This is due to the displacement of the water by the hull of the boat, which creates an upward force that is greater than the downward force of gravity.", "The buoyancy of the boat, which is the ability of a boat to float in water, is what keeps it from sinking. This buoyancy is created by the displacement of water caused by the boat's hull.", "The boats are kept afloat by the buoyancy of the air and water in the hulls.", "The buoyancy of the water keeps the boats from sinking. The boat's hull is designed to displace a certain amount of water, and the weight of the boat must be less than the weight of the water it displaces in order to stay afloat.", "The boats are buoyant because they are filled with air-filled compartments that displace the water, making them lighter than the water they are floating in.", "The boats are kept afloat by air-filled compartments called flotation chambers.", "Buoyancy is the force that keeps boats and other objects afloat. This force is created by the displacement of water when an object is placed in it.", "The boats are kept from sinking by the buoyancy of the water, which is created by the displacement of the water by the hull of the boat.", "The boats are kept from sinking by the buoyancy of the hulls, which are designed to displace a certain amount of water and thus remain afloat. The hulls are also filled with air or foam to provide additional buoyancy.", "The boats are kept from sinking by their hulls, which are designed to displace enough water to keep them afloat."]
