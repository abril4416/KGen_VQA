A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it. Some kite designs don\u2019t need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is \u201ca collection of tether-coupled wing sets", "Kites are tethered flying objects which fly by using aerodynamic lift, requiring wind, (or towing), for generation of airflow over the lifting surfaces.", "Kites are tethered flying objects which fly by using aerodynamic lift, requiring wind, (or towing), for generation of airflow over the lifting surfaces.", "Kites can be flown in a park.", "Kites have been flown since remote antiquity, both for recreation and scientific investigation.", "Kites are tethered flying objects which fly by using aerodynamic lift, requiring wind, (or towing), for generation of airflow over the lifting surfaces.", "The kites are flying in the sky.", "Kite flying is a popular sport.", "Kites are tethered flying objects which fly by using aerodynamic lift, requiring wind, (or towing), for generation of airflow over the lifting surfaces.", "Kites are flying in the sky.", "The kites are flying in the sky.", "A kite is traditionally characterized by a bridle and tail, a set of wings, and a line.
