["A traffic signal, or traffic light, stop light, traffic lamp, stop and go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.

The green light means go. The yellow light means slow down.", "Traffic lights, also known as traffic signals, traffic lamps, traffic semaphore, signal lights, stop lights, robots (in South Africa and most of Africa), and traffic control signals (in technical parlance), are signalling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control flows of traffic.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stop light, traffic lamp, stop and go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A traffic light, traffic lamp, traffic signal, stop light, traffic semaphore, signal light, stop-and-go lights, robot or traffic controller is a signaling device at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "Traffic signals are usually placed at a road junction, pedestrian crossing, or other location that requires management of conflicting flows of traffic.", "A traffic light, also known as traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "The traffic signal indicates that drivers should stop.", "A green light means go.", "Drivers should stop at a red light.", "A traffic light, also known as traffic signal, stop light, traffic lamp, stop and go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A traffic light (traffic signal, traffic lamp, stoplight) is a signaling device at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A stop signal is a signal to stop.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go lights, traffic lamp, traffic semaphore, signal light, stop-and-go light, robot or traffic controller, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stoplight, stop sign, traffic lamp, traffic semaphore, signal light, stop-and-go lights, robot or traffic controller, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "The traffic signal indicates that drivers should stop.", "A traffic signal is a signal, usually electronic or mechanical, for regulating the movement of traffic by giving information and instructions to drivers.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stop light, traffic lamp, stop-and-go lights, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.", "A traffic light, also known as a traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go light, robot or semaphore, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location.
