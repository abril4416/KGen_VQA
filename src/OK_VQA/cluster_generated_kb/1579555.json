["A toy train is a toy that represents a train. It is distinguished from a model train by an emphasis on low cost and durability, rather than scale modeling. A toy train can be as simple as a pull toy that does not even run on track, or it might be operated by clockwork or a battery. Most scales are smaller than the commonly used model railroading scales. The most popular scales are O scale and HO scale.", "A train is a form of transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad track to transport cargo or passengers.", "The model railroads you can build using Factory Direct Trains-bought products and accessories are unlimited.
