["The train, as well as the other modes of transportation, likely employ a braking system to stop. This system uses friction to slow the vehicle down.", "The different modes of transportation seen here likely employ brakes to stop, such as air brakes, disc brakes, or friction brakes.", "The different modes of transportation seen here likely employ brakes to stop. Brakes are used to slow or stop the motion of a vehicle, and are typically operated by pressing a pedal or lever.", "The different modes of transportation seen here may employ a variety of mechanisms to stop, such as brakes, friction, air pressure, or a combination of all three.", "The different modes of transportation seen here may employ a braking system to slow down or stop, such as air brakes, friction brakes, or electromagnetic brakes.", "All modes of transportation seen here likely employ a braking system to stop, which is a mechanism that uses friction to slow down and stop the vehicle.", "The different modes of transportation seen here are likely to employ brakes to stop.", "The different modes of transportation seen here likely employ a braking system to stop, which uses friction to slow down the moving vehicle.", "All different modes of transportation seen here might employ a braking system to stop. Braking systems use friction to slow down or stop a vehicle, and are used in cars, trains, and other forms of transportation.", "All modes of transportation seen here likely employ brakes to slow down or stop. Trains, cars, and skateboards all use brakes to slow down or stop.", "All the modes of transportation seen here likely employ a braking system to stop. This system utilizes friction to slow down and eventually stop the vehicle.", "The different modes of transportation seen here likely employ a braking system to stop, which uses friction to slow down the vehicle. Additionally, the train may also use an electromagnetic braking system, which uses magnets to slow down the train.", "All different modes of transportation seen here likely employ a braking system to stop. Braking systems use friction to slow down and stop a vehicle, such as a train, car, or bike."]
