["At the top of the mountain, the precipitation is likely snow, as the temperatures are much colder at higher altitudes.", "The kind of precipitation at the top of the mountain is likely snow, as it is common for snow to accumulate on mountain peaks.", "The top of the mountain is likely to have snow or other forms of precipitation due to the higher elevation.", "At the top of the mountain, there is likely snow or ice due to the elevation. The precipitation is likely to be more intense the higher up the mountain one goes.", "It is not possible to determine the type of precipitation at the top of the mountain without more information. However, it is likely that the higher elevation of the mountain range would result in cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the lower elevations.", "The amount of precipitation at the top of the mountain depends on the climate of the region. In mountainous regions, the top of the mountain is likely to receive more precipitation than the valley below due to the increased elevation.", "The precipitation at the top of the mountain is likely snow, as mountain peaks tend to have colder temperatures and higher elevations than the valleys.", "The precipitation at the top of the mountain is likely snow or hail, depending on the time of year and the elevation.", "The amount of precipitation at the top of the mountain will depend on the climate of the area. In areas with a temperate climate, the top of the mountain may receive more snowfall than the lower elevations. In areas with a tropical climate, the top of the mountain may receive more rainfall than the lower elevations.", "The amount of precipitation at the top of the mountain depends on the season and the weather. In general, the higher the elevation, the more likely it is to experience snowfall or other forms of precipitation.", "The top of the mountain is likely to have snow or ice, as these are the most common forms of precipitation in mountainous regions.", "The top of the mountain is likely to have snow or ice due to its elevation.", "At the top of the mountain, it is likely to be cold and wet, with the possibility of snow or sleet."]
